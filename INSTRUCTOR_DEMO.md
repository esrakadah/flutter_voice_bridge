```

### **üèóÔ∏è Part 2: Architecture Deep Dive (3 minutes)**

**"Now let's see how this complex system actually works..."**

#### **Show Architecture Diagrams** (Open README.md)
1. **System Architecture Overview**
   - Point to each layer: "Flutter ‚Üí Platform Channels ‚Üí Native ‚Üí FFI ‚Üí AI"
   - "Notice we have **THREE integration patterns**: Platform Channels, FFI, AND Platform Views"
   - "This demonstrates the complete spectrum of Flutter native integration"

2. **Recording & Transcription Flow**
   - Walk through the sequence diagram
   - "User taps ‚Üí Native recording ‚Üí FFI transcription ‚Üí GPU processing ‚Üí UI update"
   - "Metal GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon provides 2-3x performance boost"

**üí¨ Key Talking Points:**
- "This isn't just a Flutter app - it's a **sophisticated native integration suite**"
- "Platform Channels for audio I/O, FFI for AI processing, Platform Views for native UI"
- "Metal GPU on Apple Silicon, comprehensive memory management"
- "This is **production-grade architecture** used in enterprise applications"

### **üîß Part 3: Code Walkthrough (3 minutes)**

**"Let's look at the implementation that makes this possible..."**

#### **Show Platform Channel Integration** (`lib/core/platform/platform_channels.dart`)
```dart
// Show this specific code
static Future<String> startRecording() async {
  try {
    final String result = await _audioChannel.invokeMethod('startRecording');
    developer.log('‚úÖ Recording started: $result');
    return result;
  } on PlatformException catch (e) {
    developer.log('‚ùå Platform error: ${e.code} - ${e.message}');
    rethrow;
  }
}
```

**üí¨ Say:** "Robust error handling and structured logging - this is production code"

#### **Show FFI Integration** (`lib/core/transcription/whisper_ffi_service.dart`)
```dart
// Show this section - multi-path library loading
void _loadAppleLibrary() {
  final List<String> libraryPaths = [
    'libwhisper_ffi.dylib',                    // Standard @rpath
    'macos/Runner/libwhisper_ffi.dylib',       // Development path
    'Frameworks/libwhisper_ffi.dylib',         // App bundle
    // ... fallback paths
  ];
  
  for (final libraryPath in libraryPaths) {
    try {
      _whisperLib = DynamicLibrary.open(libraryPath);
      return; // Success!
    } catch (e) {
      continue; // Try next path
    }
  }
}
```

**üí¨ Say:** "This is production-grade error recovery - multi-path loading for robustness"

#### **Show Memory Management** (same file)
```dart
// Show this memory safety pattern
Future<String> transcribeAudio(String audioFilePath) async {
  final audioPathPtr = audioFilePath.toNativeUtf8();
  Pointer<Utf8> resultPtr = nullptr;
  
  try {
    resultPtr = _whisperTranscribe(_whisperContext!, audioPathPtr);
    return resultPtr.toDartString();
  } finally {
    malloc.free(audioPathPtr);           // ‚úÖ Always freed
    if (resultPtr != nullptr) {
      _whisperFreeString(resultPtr);     // ‚úÖ Always freed
    }
  }
}
```

**üí¨ Say:** "Production-grade memory management - no leaks, comprehensive cleanup"

#### **Show Clean Architecture** (`lib/ui/views/home/home_cubit.dart`)
```dart
// Show the state management
Future<void> startRecording() async {
  emit(RecordingInProgress());
  try {
    final path = await _audioService.startRecording();
    emit(RecordingInProgress(recordingPath: path));
  } catch (e) {
    emit(RecordingError(e.toString()));
  }
}
```

**üí¨ Say:** "Clean separation of concerns - UI doesn't know about native code"
