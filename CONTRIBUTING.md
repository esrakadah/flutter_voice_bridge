## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Fork & Clone**
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutter_voice_bridge.git
cd flutter_voice_bridge
git remote add upstream https://github.com/esrakadah/flutter_voice_bridge.git
```

### 2. **Setup Development Environment**
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build native libraries
./scripts/build_whisper.sh

# Verify everything works
flutter test
flutter run -d macos  # or ios/android
```

### 3. **Create a Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/nasty-bug
```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### **Code Style**
- Follow [Dart/Flutter style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive documentation for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused (< 20 lines when possible)

### **Testing Requirements**
- Add unit tests for new business logic
- Add widget tests for new UI components
- Test on multiple platforms (iOS, macOS, Android)
- Ensure all existing tests pass

### **Commit Guidelines**
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
```bash
feat: add new animation mode for particles
fix: resolve memory leak in FFI service
docs: improve setup instructions for Windows
test: add unit tests for transcription service
```

### **Platform Considerations**
- **iOS/macOS**: Test on both simulator and device
- **Android**: Test on different API levels (21+)
- **Native Code**: Ensure memory safety in FFI/Platform Channels
- **Performance**: Profile memory usage and rendering performance
