## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Implementation ✅
- **Flutter SDK** 3.32.2 | **Dart** 3.8.1
- **Platform Channels** - `voice.bridge/audio` channel
- **State Management** - BLoC/Cubit pattern
- **Dependency Injection** - GetIt service locator
- **Native iOS** - AVAudioRecorder, AVAudioSession
- **Native Android** - MediaRecorder (implemented)

### Future Phases 🔮
- **FFI** - C/C++ Whisper integration
- **Isolates** - Background transcription
- **Platform Views** - Native UI components

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.32.2+ | Xcode 15+ | iOS 14+
- **For iOS 26.0 beta**: Use `--release` mode only

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flutter_voice_bridge
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
flutter run --release  # iOS 26.0 beta compatible
```

## 📚 Architecture Overview

**Clean Architecture (MVVM)** with clear separation:
- **UI Layer**: Views (screens) → Widgets (reusable) → Components (atomic)
- **Business Logic**: Cubits (state management) + States (immutable)
- **Data Layer**: Services (platform integration) + Models (entities)
- **Platform Layer**: Platform Channels → Native iOS/Android

> 🏗️ **Detailed Architecture**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for component diagrams, data flow, and technical implementation details.

## 📱 Platform Implementation Status

### iOS ✅ **Fully Working**
- **Platform Channel**: `voice.bridge/audio` ✅
- **AVAudioRecorder**: High-quality .m4a recording ✅
- **Permissions**: Automatic microphone access ✅
- **File Management**: Documents directory with timestamps ✅
- **iOS 26.0 Beta**: Compatible in `--release` mode ✅
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and recovery ✅

### Android ✅ **Implemented**
- **MediaRecorder**: .m4a output format ✅
- **File Storage**: App-specific directories ✅
- **Permissions**: RECORD_AUDIO handling ✅

## 🧪 Verified Functionality

### ✅ Real Test Results (iOS 26.0 Beta)

**Platform Channel Communication:**
```
🎙️ [iOS] Audio channel method called: startRecording
🎤 [iOS] startRecording called
✅ [iOS] Microphone permission already granted
```

**Native Audio Recording:**
```
✅ [iOS] Audio session configured successfully
📁 [iOS] Generated file path: .../voice_memo_1752041485.m4a
✅ [iOS] Recording started successfully
📊 [iOS] Recording status - isRecording: true
```

**File Creation & Verification:**
```
📁 [iOS] Recording stopped, file saved to: .../voice_memo_1752041485.m4a
✅ [iOS] File verified - size: 90054 bytes
🏁 [iOS] audioRecorderDidFinishRecording - success: true
```

**Result**: Perfect 90KB .m4a audio file created with high-quality AAC encoding.

### 🧪 Manual Testing Checklist

| Test Case | Status | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Tap mic button | ✅ **Works** | Records audio, shows timer |
| Stop recording | ✅ **Works** | Saves .m4a file, shows completion |
| Permission denied | ✅ **Handled** | Shows error state gracefully |
| File verification | ✅ **Works** | Creates 44.1kHz AAC .m4a files |
| Multiple taps | ✅ **Handled** | State management prevents conflicts |

## 🔧 iOS 26.0 Beta Solution

**Issue**: Dart VM crashes with memory protection errors in debug/profile modes  
**Solution**: Use release mode for physical devices  
**Command**: `flutter run -d "DEVICE_ID" --release`  
**Why**: Release mode uses AOT compilation, bypassing JIT memory restrictions

### Device Compatibility
| iOS Version | Debug Mode | Profile Mode | Release Mode |
|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| iOS 14-25   | ✅ Works   | ✅ Works     | ✅ Works     |
| iOS 26.0 β  | ❌ Crashes | ❌ Crashes   | ✅ **Works** |
