# 🎙️ Flutter Voice Bridge

**Flutter Voice Bridge** is a **production-ready** cross-platform application showcasing advanced integration of native device features and local AI capabilities within a Flutter app. It provides a robust foundation for building voice-powered applications, featuring audio recording, playback, and **working offline speech-to-text transcription** using `Whisper.cpp`.

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles and demonstrates **real-world implementation** of complex Flutter concepts including FFI, Platform Channels, and AI integration.

> **🎯 Status**: Currently **85% complete** with full iOS/macOS transcription support and comprehensive Android audio features. Perfect for learning advanced Flutter development patterns.

## ✨ Features

- **✅ Cross-Platform Audio Recording**: High-quality audio capture on iOS, macOS, and Android with optimized formats.
- **✅ Local Audio Playback**: Play recorded memos directly within the app across all platforms.
- **✅ Offline Speech-to-Text**: **WORKING** on-device transcription using `Whisper.cpp` via Dart FFI. No internet connection required.
- **✅ Real-time Audio Visualization**: Custom waveform, spectrum, and particle visualizations during recording.
- **✅ Keyword Extraction**: Automatic keyword detection from transcribed text with intelligent filtering.
- **✅ Clean Architecture (MVVM)**: A clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers.
- **✅ Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling and enhanced testability using `get_it`.
- **✅ State Management with BLoC/Cubit**: Predictable and scalable state management with real-time UI updates.
- **✅ Native Integration**: Deep integration with native APIs via Platform Channels and Dart FFI.
- **✅ GPU Acceleration**: Metal GPU support on Apple Silicon for fast AI inference.
- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete guides for architecture, setup, and feature implementation.

## 🏛️ Project Architecture

The application is structured using a clean, layered architecture that separates concerns and promotes modularity.

- **Presentation Layer**: Flutter widgets, UI components, and state management (BLoC/Cubit).
- **Business Logic Layer**: Application logic, use cases, and state orchestration.
- **Data Layer**: Abstract repositories and data sources.
- **Platform Layer**: Native integrations (Platform Channels, FFI) and device-specific services.

For detailed feature implementation status and checklist, see [**Feature Status (`FEATURE_STATUS.md`)**](./FEATURE_STATUS.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Flutter**: Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed. [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **IDE**: Android Studio or Visual Studio Code with the Flutter plugin.
- **Platform-specific tools**:
  - **macOS/iOS**: Xcode and CocoaPods.
  - **Android**: Android SDK and NDK.
  - **Build tools**: `cmake` and `git` are required for building the native `whisper.cpp` library.

### 2. Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter_voice_bridge.git
cd flutter_voice_bridge

# 2. Install Flutter packages
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Native Dependencies Setup (Whisper.cpp)

This project includes a **working** native `Whisper.cpp` library for offline transcription. The FFI integration is already configured and functional.

**✅ Status**: Native libraries and models are already included in the repository for immediate use.

```bash
# No additional setup required - libraries are pre-compiled and included
# The app will automatically extract and use the Whisper model on first run
```

**What's Included**:
1. ✅ Pre-compiled `whisper.cpp` libraries for iOS/macOS 
2. ✅ English language model (`ggml-base.en.bin` - 147MB)
3. ✅ FFI wrapper with proper memory management
4. ✅ Platform-specific integration ready to use

**Current Support**:
- **iOS/macOS**: ✅ Full transcription support (WAV format)
- **Android**: ⚠️ Audio recording works, transcription needs format conversion

For implementation details, see [**Feature Status (`FEATURE_STATUS.md`)**](./FEATURE_STATUS.md).

### 4. Running the App

The app is ready to run immediately with full transcription capabilities on iOS/macOS.

```bash
# Run on iOS/macOS for full transcription features
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d macos

# Run on Android for audio recording and playback
flutter run -d android
```

**🎉 First Launch**: The app will automatically extract the Whisper model to device storage (~147MB) and you can immediately start recording and transcribing voice memos!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ✅ Transcription Working Status

**Current Status (July 2025)**:
- **iOS/macOS**: ✅ **Transcription fully working** - WAV format compatibility fixed
- **Android**: ⚠️ Audio recording works, transcription needs M4A→WAV conversion

### Android Recording Permissions

The app handles runtime audio recording permissions automatically:
1. Grant microphone permission when prompted
2. The app will guide you through any permission issues
3. Recording and playback work perfectly on Android

### iOS/macOS Transcription Success

**Fixed Issues**:
- ✅ Audio format compatibility (now uses WAV instead of M4A)
- ✅ Whisper model loading and extraction
- ✅ FFI memory management
- ✅ GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon

### Whisper Model Management

**Automatic Model Handling**:
- ✅ Model is automatically extracted from app assets
- ✅ No manual download or setup required
- ✅ 147MB English model included and working
- ✅ Metal GPU acceleration enabled

### Performance Optimization

**Apple Silicon Benefits**:
- 🚀 M1/M2/M3 Mac: GPU-accelerated transcription
- ⚡ Fast inference with Metal backend
- 💾 Efficient memory usage with proper cleanup
